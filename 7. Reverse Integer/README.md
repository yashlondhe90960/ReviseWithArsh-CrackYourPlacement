# Reverse Integer

## Description

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).


```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```

Example 2:

```
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```
Example 3:

```
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```
