/*
 * Sort the elements of an array of strings called "strs" in lexicographic
 * (alphabetical) order using the Arrays.sort(strs) method.
 * 
 * Assign the first element of the sorted array (the lexicographically smallest
 * string) to a string variable s1.
 * 
 * Assign the last element of the sorted array (the lexicographically largest
 * string) to a string variable s2.
 * 
 * Initialize an integer variable idx to 0.
 * 
 * Start a while loop that continues while idx is less than the length of s1 and
 * s2.
 * 
 * Within the while loop, check if the character at the current index in s1 is
 * equal to the character at the same index in s2. If the characters are equal,
 * increment the value of idx by 1.
 * 
 * If the characters are not equal, exit the while loop.
 * 
 * Return the substring of s1 that starts from the first character and ends at
 * the idxth character (exclusive).
