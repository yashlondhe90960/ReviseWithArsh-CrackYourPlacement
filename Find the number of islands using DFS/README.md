# Find the number of islands using DFS

## Description

Given a binary 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 5 islands.
 
Example 1:


```
Input: mat[][] = {{1, 1, 0, 0, 0},
                           {0, 1, 0, 0, 1},
                           {1, 0, 0, 1, 1},
                          {0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
                         {1, 0, 1, 0, 0}}
Output: 5
```

This is a variation of the standard problem: “Counting the number of connected components in an undirected graph”.
